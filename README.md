# Blog with Spring-boot


A simple blog with springboot

I implemented this project to learn spring boot and Thymeleaf.

It's a simple blog to handle posts and their categories, and manage users of the blog. The authentication and authorization is developed by spring security

This is the first project is implemented by Spring-boot as backend framework and Thymeleaf as fronted.

---

It was so delicious to learn a trend and powerful framework like Spring-boot, because it is so common to use this framework for huge project.

This blog is divided to two module; Posts module and Users module.

The most challenging part was learning Spring security to handle users authentication and authorization.
